### **Claude Code Prompt: Full Implementation of a Five-Step AI Reply System for TweetCraft**

**High-Level Goal:**

Refactor the TweetCraft AI Reply feature from its current "Templates & Tones" system (seen in the screenshot) into a new, five-step sequential workflow. This new system will be implemented entirely within the "All" tab of the AI Reply popup, as rendered by `src/content/unifiedSelector.ts`. The new architecture is based on the provided lists for `Persona & Framing`, `Attitude`, `Rhetoric`, `Vocabulary`, and `Format & Pacing` which you can find below. Ensure your implementation is fully compatible with the current architecture. Build detailed to do lists with tasks and subtasks when working on this project. 

CRITICAL: THE REFACTORING NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE ALL TAB OF THE AI PROMPT SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE HAVE NOW TEMPLATES & TONES. IT WILL BE A LONGER LIST AFTER REFACTOR SO ADD A SCROLL BAR. DO NOT CHANGE THE DESIGN, DO NOT CHANGE THE UX/UI.

Your task is to implement the full data structure, the new UI, the prompt concatenation logic for the orchestrator LLM, and the Tier 1 conflict warning system. Adhere to the consumer-focused principles in `CLAUDE.md`. The current prompt should be used as guidance whenver you require further clarification and can be found here: D:\repos\personal\tweetcraft\AI Reply Tones & Styles Refactor.md

### **Step 1: Overhaul the Data Structure (`src/config/templatesAndTones.ts`)**

The foundation of this refactor is a new, comprehensive data structure.

**Instructions:**

1.  Navigate to `src/config/templatesAndTones.ts`.
2.  Remove or comment out the existing `TEMPLATES`, `TONES`, and `REPLY_CONFIG` constants.
3.  Replace them with the following single, comprehensive exported constant named `REPLY_OPTIONS`. This object contains all options for the five new categories, including their prompts and the full list of incompatibility rules for the warning system. **This is the new single source of truth.**

**Full `REPLY_OPTIONS` Constant (Copy this directly into the file):**

// src/config/templatesAndTones.ts

export const REPLY_OPTIONS = {

### **Step 2: Rebuild the UI in `src/content/unifiedSelector.ts`**

Modify the `UnifiedSelector` class to render the new five-step UI and manage selections and conflict warnings.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Import the New Data Structure:**
    ```typescript
    import { REPLY_OPTIONS } from '@/config/templatesAndTones';
    ```

2.  **Add State Management:** In the `UnifiedSelector` class, add a property to hold the user's selections.
    ```typescript
    private selections: { [key: string]: string | null } = {
      personaFraming: null,
      attitude: null,
      rhetoric: null,
      vocabulary: null,
      formatPacing: null,
    };
    ```

3.  **Update the `render()` Method:** Replace the existing rendering logic with a new structure that creates the five sequential sections.

    **Conceptual `render()` Logic:**
    ```typescript
    // Inside UnifiedSelector.ts

    private render(): void {
      if (!this.container) return;
      this.container.innerHTML = `
        <div class="unified-selector-header">...</div>
        <div class="unified-selector-content">
          ${this.renderCategory('personaFraming', 'Step 1: Persona & Framing')}
          ${this.renderCategoryWithSubgroups('attitude', 'Step 2: Attitude')}
          ${this.renderCategoryWithSubgroups('rhetoric', 'Step 3: Rhetoric')}
          ${this.renderCategoryWithSubgroups('vocabulary', 'Step 4: Vocabulary')}
          ${this.renderCategory('formatPacing', 'Step 5: Format & Pacing')}
        </div>
        <div class="unified-selector-footer">
          <button class="generate-button">Generate Reply</button>
        </div>
      `;
      this.attachEventListeners();
      this.updateWarnings(); // Initial warning check
    }

    private renderCategory(key: string, title: string): string {
      const options = REPLY_OPTIONS[key as keyof typeof REPLY_OPTIONS] as any[];
      return `
        <div class="selector-category">
          <h3 class="category-title">${title}</h3>
          <div class="options-grid">
            ${options.map(opt => this.renderOptionButton(opt, key)).join('')}
          </div>
        </div>
      `;
    }
    
    private renderCategoryWithSubgroups(key: string, title: string): string {
      const subgroups = REPLY_OPTIONS[key as keyof typeof REPLY_OPTIONS] as Record<string, any[]>;
      let html = `<div class="selector-category"><h3 class="category-title">${title}</h3>`;
      for (const subKey in subgroups) {
        // Simple title from camelCase, e.g., directEngagement -> Direct Engagement
        const subTitle = subKey.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1').replace(/^./, str => str.toUpperCase());
        html += `<h4 class="category-subtitle">${subTitle}</h4>`;
        html += `<div class="options-grid">${subgroups[subKey].map(opt => this.renderOptionButton(opt, key)).join('')}</div>`;
      }
      html += `</div>`;
      return html;
    }

    private renderOptionButton(option: any, categoryKey: string): string {
      const isSelected = this.selections[categoryKey] === option.id;
      return `
        <button class="option-button ${isSelected ? 'selected' : ''}" data-id="${option.id}" data-category="${categoryKey}" title="${option.description}">
          ${option.label}
        </button>
      `;
    }
    ```

4.  **Implement Selection Logic and Warning System:** Create methods to handle clicks and update the UI with conflict warnings.

    **Code to Add to `UnifiedSelector.ts`:**
    ```typescript
    // Inside UnifiedSelector.ts

    private handleOptionClick(event: MouseEvent) {
      const button = (event.currentTarget as HTMLElement);
      const optionId = button.dataset.id;
      const category = button.dataset.category;

      if (!optionId || !category) return;
      
      // Toggle selection logic
      if (this.selections[category] === optionId) {
        this.selections[category] = null; // Deselect
      } else {
        this.selections[category] = optionId; // Select
      }

      // Re-render or update classes to reflect selection
      this.updateSelectedVisuals();
      this.updateWarnings();
    }

    private updateSelectedVisuals() {
      const allButtons = this.container.querySelectorAll('.option-button');
      allButtons.forEach(button => {
        const optionId = button.getAttribute('data-id');
        const category = button.getAttribute('data-category');
        if (optionId && category) {
          button.classList.toggle('selected', this.selections[category] === optionId);
        }
      });
    }

    private updateWarnings() {
      const allSelectedIds = Object.values(this.selections).filter(Boolean) as string[];
      const allOptionsFlat = Object.values(REPLY_OPTIONS).flat(2); // Flatten all options

      this.container.querySelectorAll('.option-button').forEach(button => {
        const optionId = button.getAttribute('data-id');
        
        // Remove existing warning
        const existingWarning = button.querySelector('.conflict-warning');
        if (existingWarning) existingWarning.remove();

        const optionData = allOptionsFlat.find(opt => opt.id === optionId);
        if (!optionData || !optionData.incompatibleWith) return;

        const isConflicting = allSelectedIds.some(selectedId => 
          optionData.incompatibleWith.includes(selectedId)
        );

        if (isConflicting && !button.classList.contains('selected')) {
          const warningIcon = document.createElement('span');
          warningIcon.className = 'conflict-warning';
          warningIcon.textContent = ' ‚ö†Ô∏è';
          warningIcon.title = 'May conflict with your other selections.';
          button.appendChild(warningIcon);
          button.classList.add('conflicting');
        } else {
          button.classList.remove('conflicting');
        }
      });
    }
    ```

5.  **Add CSS for Warnings:** Add styles for the warning icon and conflicting state in your relevant SCSS file (e.g., `src/content/unifiedSelector.scss`).
    ```scss
    .option-button.conflicting {
      opacity: 0.6;
      border-style: dashed;
    }
    .conflict-warning {
      color: orange;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```

### **Step 3: Update Prompt Orchestration in `src/background/serviceWorker.ts`**

HOW THE COMBINATIONS WILL BE SENT TO THE LLM
	
A concatenated  structure is the correct way to orchestrate this. You would concatenate the individual prompts selected by the user into a single, comprehensive "meta-prompt" for the LLM.

Here is a concrete example. Let's say a user selects the following five options:

1.  **Persona:** üé≠ **Expert Persona**
2.  **Attitude:** üôÉ **Dry/Deadpan**
3.  **Rhetoric:** ‚ùó **Risk/Caveat**
4.  **Vocabulary:** üõ†Ô∏è **Technical/Engineer**
5.  **Format & Pacing:** üó£Ô∏è **Single Sentence Reply**

The final instruction sent to the LLM would be a combination of all five individual prompts, like this:

**Master Prompt Sent to LLM:**

> Generate a Tweet reply to `[Original Tweet Text]` based on the following combined instructions. The core idea to convey is `[User's Core Idea]`.
> 
> *   **Persona Instruction:** Generate a reply from the persona of a seasoned expert who has seen this topic debated endlessly. The tone should be slightly jaded, direct, and pragmatic, but ultimately helpful. Start with a phrase like 'Look,' or 'The thing is...'.
> *   **Attitude Instruction:** The reply must have an understated, ironic tone. The humor should come from a complete lack of obvious emotion.
> *   **Rhetoric Instruction:** The reply must point out a potential risk, edge case, or important caveat to the argument in the original tweet.
> *   **Vocabulary Instruction:** The reply must use language focused on systems, constraints, trade-offs, and first principles. The vocabulary should be technical but clear.
> *   **Format Instruction:** The final output must be a single, complete sentence.

Modify the service worker to accept the five selection IDs and build the final, concatenated prompt.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Modify `handleGenerateReply`:** Ensure the message from the content script now includes the `selections` object.
2.  **Rewrite `buildMessages`:** Replace the old logic with the new concatenation strategy.

**Updated `buildMessages` function in `serviceWorker.ts`:**
```typescript
// src/background/serviceWorker.ts

import { REPLY_OPTIONS } from '@/config/templatesAndTones'; // Ensure this import works

private async buildMessages(request: any, context: any, config: any): Promise<OpenRouterMessage[]> {
  const { selections } = request; // selections = { personaFraming: '...', attitude: '...', ... }

  let systemPrompt = config.systemPrompt || 'You are a helpful social media assistant.';

  const instructions: string[] = [];
  const allOptionsFlat = Object.values(REPLY_OPTIONS).flat(2);

  // Define the order of prompt concatenation
  const categoryOrder: (keyof typeof selections)[] = ['personaFraming', 'attitude', 'rhetoric', 'vocabulary', 'formatPacing'];

  for (const category of categoryOrder) {
    const selectedId = selections[category];
    if (selectedId) {
      const selectedOption = allOptionsFlat.find(opt => opt.id === selectedId);
      if (selectedOption && selectedOption.prompt) {
        instructions.push(selectedOption.prompt);
      }
    }
  }

  if (instructions.length > 0) {
    systemPrompt += "\n\nCRITICAL: You must generate a reply following these specific, combined instructions:\n- " + instructions.join("\n- ");
  }

  // The rest of the function (building the user prompt with tweet context) can remain the same.
  const userPrompt = this.buildUserPrompt(request, context, config);

  return [
    { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
    { role: 'user', content: userPrompt }
  ];
}

// You will also need a buildUserPrompt helper function containing the logic
// from the old buildMessages that handled context, rewrite mode, etc.
private buildUserPrompt(request: any, context: any, config: any): string {
  // ... (Paste the user prompt creation logic from your old buildMessages here)
  // This includes handling rewrite mode, thread context, single tweet context, etc.
  // Example start:
  if (request.isRewriteMode && request.existingText) {
    return `Please rewrite and improve this tweet reply while maintaining its core message:\n\n"${request.existingText}"\n\nContext - this is a reply to: "${context.tweetText}"`;
  }
  // ... etc.
  return `Write a reply to this tweet: "${context.tweetText}"`;
}
```
Yes, absolutely. My apologies for not making that section prominent enough. The Tier 1 solution‚Äîdisplaying non-blocking warnings for conflicting selections‚Äîis a critical part of the user experience, and its implementation was embedded within the UI refactoring steps.

Let me extract, clarify, and detail that specific part of the implementation for you.

Here is the explicit, step-by-step guide on **how to implement the Tier 1 conflict handling system** using the data and code from the previous prompt.

---

### **How to Handle Potential Overlaps and Conflicting Scenarios (Tier 1 Solution)**

The Tier 1 solution works by visually indicating potential conflicts without preventing the user from making a selection. This is achieved through a combination of data structure, UI logic, and CSS.

#### **Step 1: The Data Foundation (The Rules)**

The core of the conflict system resides in the `incompatibleWith` array within your new `REPLY_OPTIONS` data structure in `src/config/templatesAndTones.ts`. Each option explicitly declares which other options it conflicts with.

**Example from the data structure:**

```typescript
// src/config/templatesAndTones.ts

export const REPLY_OPTIONS = {
  // ...
  attitude: {
    // ...
    antagonistic: [
      { 
        id: 'attitude-mean', 
        label: 'üò† Mean/Hostile',
        // ...
        // This option is incompatible with the following IDs:
        incompatibleWith: [
          'persona-nurturer',         // Can't be a nurturer and mean
          'framing-humble',           // Can't be humble and mean
          'framing-collaborative',    // Can't be collaborative and mean
          'rhetoric-steel-man',       // Can't steel-man and be mean
          'attitude-supportive'       // Direct contradiction
        ] 
      },
      // ...
    ]
  },
  // ...
};
```

This data structure is the "brain" of the conflict system. The UI logic will read from these arrays to determine what to do.

#### **Step 2: The UI Logic (The "How-To" Check)**

This logic lives inside your `src/content/unifiedSelector.ts` file. You need a function that runs every time the user's selections change. This function will check for conflicts and update the UI accordingly.

**Implementation in `UnifiedSelector.ts`:**

Add this exact method to your `UnifiedSelector` class. It performs the core logic for the Tier 1 warning system.

```typescript
// src/content/unifiedSelector.ts

// (Inside the UnifiedSelector class)

private updateWarnings(): void {
  // 1. Get a simple list of all currently selected option IDs.
  const allSelectedIds = Object.values(this.selections).filter(Boolean) as string[];

  // 2. Flatten the entire REPLY_OPTIONS object to make searching easier.
  //    The `flat(2)` is used because some categories have sub-groups.
  const allOptionsFlat = Object.values(REPLY_OPTIONS).flat(2);

  // 3. Iterate over every single button in the UI.
  this.container?.querySelectorAll('.option-button').forEach(button => {
    const buttonElement = button as HTMLElement;
    const optionId = buttonElement.dataset.id;

    if (!optionId) return;

    // 4. Clean up any previous warning icon from this button.
    const existingWarning = buttonElement.querySelector('.conflict-warning');
    if (existingWarning) {
      existingWarning.remove();
    }
    buttonElement.classList.remove('conflicting');

    // 5. Find the full data for the current button's option.
    const optionData = allOptionsFlat.find(opt => opt.id === optionId);
    if (!optionData || !optionData.incompatibleWith || optionData.incompatibleWith.length === 0) {
      return; // No conflict rules for this option.
    }

    // 6. THE CORE LOGIC: Check if any of the currently selected IDs
    //    are present in this button's 'incompatibleWith' list.
    const isConflicting = allSelectedIds.some(selectedId => 
      optionData.incompatibleWith.includes(selectedId)
    );

    // 7. If there is a conflict AND the button isn't currently selected,
    //    apply the warning. We don't warn about the selected item itself.
    if (isConflicting && !buttonElement.classList.contains('selected')) {
      const warningIcon = document.createElement('span');
      warningIcon.className = 'conflict-warning';
      warningIcon.textContent = ' ‚ö†Ô∏è';
      warningIcon.title = 'This option may produce unpredictable results with your current selections.';
      
      buttonElement.appendChild(warningIcon);
      buttonElement.classList.add('conflicting');
    }
  });
}
```

#### **Step 3: Triggering the Logic (The "When-To" Check)**

The `updateWarnings()` function needs to be called at the right times to keep the UI in sync.

**Instructions:**

1.  Call `this.updateWarnings()` at the end of your `handleOptionClick` method. This ensures that every time a user selects or deselects an option, the warnings for all other options are immediately re-evaluated.
2.  Call `this.updateWarnings()` at the end of your main `render()` or `show()` method. This ensures that when the popup first appears, any pre-selected options correctly trigger warnings.

**Example:**
```typescript
// src/content/unifiedSelector.ts
private handleOptionClick(event: MouseEvent) {
  // ... (your selection logic here) ...
  this.updateSelectedVisuals();
  this.updateWarnings(); // <-- Add this call here
}

public show(...) {
  // ... (your logic to show the popup) ...
  this.render();
  this.updateWarnings(); // <-- And add this call here
}
```

#### **Step 4: The Visual Feedback (The UI)**

Finally, you need to add CSS to make the warnings visible to the user. This CSS goes into the stylesheet associated with your popup (e.g., a new `unifiedSelector.scss` or your existing `contentScript.scss`).

**CSS for Warnings:**

```scss
/* Add to your relevant SCSS file */

.option-button.conflicting {
  // Make the button look less prominent to suggest it's a poor choice.
  opacity: 0.65;
  border-style: dashed;
  border-color: #FFA500; // An orange warning color.

  &:hover {
    opacity: 1; // Restore full opacity on hover so user can still select it.
  }
}

.conflict-warning {
  // Style the warning icon itself.
  color: #FFA500;
  font-weight: bold;
  pointer-events: none; // Ensures the icon doesn't interfere with clicks.
}
```

Here is a comprehensive list of all the specific conflict rules. This list is designed to be directly translated into the `incompatibleWith` arrays in your `config.js` file. The rules are categorized into two main types:

1.  **Logical & Structural Conflicts:** Combinations that are functionally impossible (e.g., a multi-step guide in a single word).
2.  **Tonal & Intentional Conflicts:** Combinations that are deeply contradictory in their purpose or tone (e.g., a supportive persona with a hostile attitude).

---

### **Conflict Rules Master List**

#### **Category 1: Format & Pacing Conflicts**

These are the most rigid rules. If a user selects a specific format, it logically invalidates many rhetorical structures.

**If you select `Format: Single Word / Emoji`...**
*   ...then disable these **Rhetoric** options:
    *   `Step-by-Step`
    *   `Pros/Cons`
    *   `Compare/Contrast`
    *   `Steel-man`
    *   `Share Experience`
    *   `Add Context`
    *   `Agree & Add`
    *   `Polite Challenge`
    *   `Find Core Disagreement`
*   ...then disable these **Format & Pacing** options:
    *   All other formats (`Statement + Question`, `Mini-Thread`, `Bulleted List`, etc.)

**If you select `Format: Statement + Question`...**
*   ...then disable these **Rhetoric** options:
    *   `Step-by-Step`
    *   `Pros/Cons`
    *   `Bulleted List`
*   ...then disable these **Format & Pacing** options:
    *   `Single Word / Emoji`
    *   `Long Stream-of-Consciousness`
    *   `Mini-Thread`

**If you select `Format: Bulleted List`...**
*   ...then disable these **Format & Pacing** options:
    *   `Single Word / Emoji`
    *   `Statement + Question`
    *   `Single Sentence Reply`
    *   `Long Stream-of-Consciousness`

**If you select `Format: Mini-Thread`...**
*   ...then disable **all other `Format & Pacing` options**.

---

#### **Category 2: Persona & Framing Conflicts**

These rules are based on maintaining a consistent character.

**If you select `Persona: Nurturer` or `Bridge Builder`...**
*   ...then disable these **Attitude** options (the entire Antagonistic category):
    *   `Mean/Hostile`
    *   `Dismissive`
    *   `Inflammatory`
    *   `Condescending`
    *   `Threatening`
    *   `Sarcastic` (A nurturer is rarely sarcastic)
*   ...then disable these **Rhetoric** options:
    *   `Hot Take` (A bridge builder avoids divisive takes)

**If you select `Persona: Humble Inquirer`...**
*   ...then disable these **Persona & Framing** options:
    *   `Authoritative Voice`
*   ...then disable these **Attitude** options:
    *   `Confident`
    *   `Condescending`
    *   `Provocative`
    *   `Mean/Hostile`

**If you select `Persona: Authoritative Voice`...**
*   ...then disable these **Persona & Framing** options:
    *   `Humble Inquirer`
*   ...then disable these **Attitude** options:
    *   `Pensive/Musing` (An authoritative voice is not uncertain)
    *   `Inquisitive/Curious`

**If you select `Persona: Jester`...**
*   ...then disable this **Attitude** option:
    *   `Earnest` (A jester is fundamentally insincere or ironic)

---

#### **Category 3: Attitude Conflicts**

These rules prevent direct emotional contradictions.

**If you select any `Constructive & Nuanced` Attitude (e.g., `Supportive`, `Friendly`, `Diplomatic`, `Earnest`)...**
*   ...then disable all `Antagonistic` **Attitude** options (`Mean/Hostile`, `Dismissive`, etc.).

**If you select `Attitude: Earnest`...**
*   ...then disable these `Ironic & Edgy` **Attitude** options:
    *   `Sarcastic`
    *   `Snarky`
    *   `Dry/Deadpan`
    *   `Devil's Advocate`
*   ...then disable this **Persona**:
    *   `Jester Persona`

**If you select any `Antagonistic` Attitude (e.g., `Mean/Hostile`, `Condescending`)...**
*   ...then disable these **Persona & Framing** options:
    *   `Nurturer`
    *   `Bridge Builder`
    *   `Humble Inquirer`
*   ...then disable these collaborative **Rhetoric** options:
    *   `Steel-man` (The direct opposite of antagonism)
    *   `Agree & Add`
    *   `Concede a Point`
    *   `Gratitude/Shout-out`

---

#### **Category 4: Rhetoric Conflicts**

These rules focus on the logical intent of the reply.

**If you select `Rhetoric: Steel-man`...**
*   ...then disable all `Antagonistic` **Attitude** options.
*   ...then disable the `Jester` **Persona**. (Steel-manning requires good faith).

**If you select `Rhetoric: Agree & Add`, `Concede a Point`, or `Gratitude/Shout-out`...**
*   ...then disable these `Antagonistic` **Attitude** options:
    *   `Mean/Hostile`
    *   `Dismissive`
    *   `Condescending`

---

#### **Category 5: Vocabulary Conflicts**

These rules prevent jarring mismatches in language style.

**If you select `Vocabulary: Legal/Compliance` or `Corporate/PR`...**
*   ...then disable these informal **Vocabulary** options:
    *   `Internet/Gen Z`
    *   `Shitposter/Meme-Lord`
    *   `Fan/Stanspeak`
*   ...then disable this **Persona**:
    *   `Jester Persona`

**If you select `Vocabulary: Shitposter/Meme-Lord`...**
*   ...then disable these formal **Vocabulary** options:
    *   `Academic/Scholarly`
    *   `Corporate/PR`
    *   `Legal/Compliance`
    *   `Journalistic`
*   ...then disable these **Attitude** options:
    *   `Professional`
    *   `Earnest`

---
### **Note on Redundancy (Soft Conflicts)**

There are also "soft conflicts" where two options are not contradictory but highly redundant (e.g., `Attitude: Inquisitive/Curious` and `Rhetoric: Ask Question`). For the "graying out" logic, it's often best to **allow these combinations**, as the user might be trying to emphasize a specific intent. The LLM is generally good at merging redundant positive instructions. The most critical rules to implement are the ones that prevent logical impossibilities and direct tonal contradictions listed above.


With these four steps, you have a complete Tier 1 conflict handling system. It reads the rules from your central data structure, uses JavaScript logic to check for conflicts on every user interaction, and applies clear but non-blocking CSS styles to warn the user, fulfilling the requirements perfectly.



---

**Summary of Expected Outcome:**

After implementing these changes, the TweetCraft extension will feature a new, five-step UI in the "All" tab of the AI Reply popup. The user will be able to select one option from each category. The UI will provide visual warnings for conflicting choices. Upon clicking "Generate Reply," the selections will be sent to the service worker, which will construct a detailed, multi-instruction system prompt for the orchestrator LLM, resulting in highly specific and nuanced AI-generated replies.
