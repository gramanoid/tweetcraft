# 🏗️ TweetCraft Extension - Consumer-Focused Architecture

## 🎯 **Core Philosophy: BUILD FOR CONSUMERS, NOT ENTERPRISES**

**Design Principles:**
- Simple, fast, reliable functionality for individual users
- One-click user experience with minimal configuration
- Direct implementation over complex abstractions
- Speed and usability over feature completeness

## 🚀 **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**

### Keep It Simple
- One clear path to success for each feature
- Minimal configuration required
- Fast loading and response times
- Direct implementation over abstraction layers

### Consumer-First Design
- Features solve real individual user problems
- No complex setup or learning curves

## 🔧 **API INTEGRATION STRATEGY**

### Current Integration
- **Primary**: OpenRouter (multiple AI models with single API)
- **Storage**: Chrome storage APIs (local + sync)
- **DOM**: Twitter/X page integration

### Future Integrations (Simple)
- **Research API** (optional, for fact-checking)
- **Posting API** (optional, for automation with safety)
- **Basic Analytics API** (optional, for simple insights)

**Philosophy**: Add APIs only when they directly benefit individual users, never for enterprise complexity.
