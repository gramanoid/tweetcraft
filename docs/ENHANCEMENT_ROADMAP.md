# TweetCraft Enhancement Roadmap - v0.0.12+

## 🎯 Core Philosophy: BUILD FOR CONSUMERS, NOT ENTERPRISES
- **Simple over Complex**: Direct implementations that work reliably
- **Speed over Features**: Sub-2 second response times always
- **User-Centric Design**: Features must be intuitive within 2 minutes
- **Pragmatic Solutions**: Ship working code, not perfect abstractions

---

## 🆕 NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

After thorough codebase analysis (January 2025), actual implementation status:

### 1. **AI Tweet Creation** 🤖
**Status**: Planning  
**Effort**: 4-5 hours  
**Description**: Generate original tweets from topics

**Features**:
- Topic input field
- Style selector (informative, funny, question, hot take)
- Generate 3 variations
- Engagement prediction score
- Direct post or schedule

---

### 2. **Image Understanding for Context** 👁️
**Status**: 90% Complete ✅  
**Effort**: 0.5 hours remaining  
**Description**: Analyze images in tweets to provide richer context for AI replies

**Implementation**:
- Detect images in tweet being replied to
- Use OpenRouter vision models (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro Vision)
- Extract visual context automatically during reply generation
- Include image descriptions in reply prompt for more relevant responses
- Graceful fallback when image analysis fails or is unavailable

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic Detection**: No extra user steps - seamlessly integrated
- **Multi-Image Support**: Handle tweets with multiple images
- **Context Integration**: Visual context merged with existing text context
- **Cost Awareness**: Vision calls only when images present and feature enabled
- **Performance**: Parallel processing to avoid slowing down text-only replies

**Video Handling Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Extract video thumbnails as static images for analysis
- **Phase 2**: Parse video metadata (title, description) if accessible via Twitter API
- **Future**: Video frame analysis for key moments (low priority)
- **Fallback**: Skip video analysis, rely on tweet text and thumbnail

**Technical Approach**:
- Extend existing `contextExtractor.ts` to include image URLs
- Add vision model selection to configuration
- Implement image fetching with proper error handling
- Include visual context in existing prompt construction
- Feature flag controlled with user preference

**Consumer-First Design**:
- **Invisible to User**: Works automatically, no new UI complexity
- **Optional**: Can be disabled in settings for cost-conscious users  
- **Fast**: Parallel processing, doesn't block text reply generation
- **Robust**: Graceful degradation when images can't be analyzed

### 3. **Tones & Styles Split** 🎨
**Status**: 70% Complete (Backend exists, needs UI) ⚠️  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Description**: Refactor Templates into intuitive Tones (voice) + Styles (approach) system

**Current Problem**:
- Templates mix personality (how you sound) with approach (what you do)
- "Witty Question" vs "Sarcastic Agreement" creates confusing combinations
- Users think in terms of "I want to sound [TONE] while [STYLE]"

**Proposed Split**:

**Tones (Voice/Personality)** - HOW you sound:
- 😊 Casual - Friendly and conversational
- 💼 Professional - Formal and business-appropriate
- 😄 Witty - Clever and humorous  
- 😏 Sarcastic - Ironic and mocking
- 🔥 Spicy - Bold and provocative
- 🤗 Supportive - Encouraging and empathetic
- 🎓 Academic - Scholarly and analytical
- 😎 Gen Z - Modern slang and energy
- 🙄 Dismissive - Unimpressed and critical
- 💪 Motivational - Inspiring and energetic

**Styles (Approach/Structure)** - WHAT you do:
- ❓ Ask Question - Turn into thoughtful question
- 👍 Agree & Add - Support and expand the point
- 🤔 Polite Challenge - Respectfully disagree  
- 📚 Add Context - Provide background/explanation
- 🔗 Share Experience - Personal anecdote/story
- 🎯 Hot Take - Bold controversial opinion
- 💡 Suggest Solution - Offer practical advice
- 📊 Request Data - Ask for evidence/sources
- 🏃 Call to Action - Encourage specific response
- 😂 Make Joke - Turn into humor/meme

**Implementation**:
- Modify existing unified selector to show Tone × Style matrix
- Update prompt construction to combine tone + style instructions
- Migrate existing templates to new tone/style combinations
- Maintain backward compatibility with favorites/arsenal
- A/B test with subset of users before full rollout

**Consumer Benefits**:
- **More Intuitive**: "Sound casual while asking a question" vs complex template names
- **Better Combinations**: 10 tones × 10 styles = 100 possibilities vs 15 fixed templates
- **Faster Selection**: Users think naturally in tone + style terms
- **Cleaner UI**: Two simple dropdowns instead of long template list

**Technical Approach**:
- Extend `templatesAndTones.ts` configuration
- Update unified selector UI with two-step selection
- Modify prompt builder to combine tone + style instructions
- Add migration logic for existing user preferences
- Feature flag for gradual rollout

**Migration Strategy**:
- Current "Hot Take + Sarcastic" → "Sarcastic Tone + Hot Take Style"
- Current "Challenge Politely + Professional" → "Professional Tone + Polite Challenge Style"
- Maintain existing favorites by auto-mapping to closest tone/style combo

---

### 4. **Research Assistant** 🔬
**Status**: Planning  
**Effort**: 4-5 hours  
**Description**: Intelligent fact-checking and research integration for more credible tweets

**Implementation**:
- Quick fact verification using search APIs (Perplexity/Bing/Google)
- Real-time information retrieval for current events
- Source citation formatting with credible links
- Automatic link shortening for tweet character limits
- Context-aware research suggestions based on tweet content

**Key Features**:
- **Fact Check Mode**: Verify claims before posting controversial takes
- **Source Integration**: Add credible citations to strengthen arguments
- **Current Events**: Get latest information on trending topics
- **Link Management**: Automatic shortening and clean formatting
- **Research Suggestions**: AI suggests relevant facts/statistics

**Consumer-First Design**:
- **Optional**: Can be toggled on/off per tweet
- **Fast**: Parallel research while composing reply
- **Transparent**: Shows source confidence scores
- **Privacy-Conscious**: Uses anonymous search APIs

**Technical Approach**:
- Integrate search APIs through existing OpenRouter service architecture
- Add research toggle to unified selector interface
- Implement citation formatting for Twitter's character limits
- Cache research results to avoid duplicate API calls
- Feature flag controlled with user preference

**Use Cases**:
- Fact-checking before replying to controversial posts
- Adding supporting data to strengthen arguments
- Getting current information on breaking news
- Finding credible sources for debate responses
- Enhancing replies with relevant statistics/studies

### 5. **Arsenal Mode UI Integration** ⚡
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅  
**Effort**: 0 hours  
**Description**: Complete the Arsenal Mode feature with UI integration
