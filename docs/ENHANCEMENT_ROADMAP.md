# TweetCraft Enhancement Roadmap - v0.0.11+

## 🎯 Core Philosophy: BUILD FOR CONSUMERS, NOT ENTERPRISES
- **Simple over Complex**: Direct implementations that work reliably
- **Speed over Features**: Sub-2 second response times always
- **User-Centric Design**: Features must be intuitive within 2 minutes
- **Pragmatic Solutions**: Ship working code, not perfect abstractions

---

## 🆕 NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

After thorough codebase analysis (January 2025), actual implementation status:

### 1. **AI Tweet Creation** 🤖
**Status**: Planning  
**Effort**: 4-5 hours  
**Description**: Generate original tweets from topics

**Features**:
- Topic input field
- Style selector (informative, funny, question, hot take)
- Generate 3 variations
- Engagement prediction score
- Direct post or schedule

---

### 2. **Image Understanding for Context** 👁️
**Status**: 90% Complete ✅  
**Effort**: 0.5 hours remaining  
**Description**: Analyze images in tweets to provide richer context for AI replies

**Implementation**:
- Detect images in tweet being replied to
- Use OpenRouter vision models (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro Vision)
- Extract visual context automatically during reply generation
- Include image descriptions in reply prompt for more relevant responses
- Graceful fallback when image analysis fails or is unavailable

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic Detection**: No extra user steps - seamlessly integrated
- **Multi-Image Support**: Handle tweets with multiple images
- **Context Integration**: Visual context merged with existing text context
- **Cost Awareness**: Vision calls only when images present and feature enabled
- **Performance**: Parallel processing to avoid slowing down text-only replies

**Video Handling Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Extract video thumbnails as static images for analysis
- **Phase 2**: Parse video metadata (title, description) if accessible via Twitter API
- **Future**: Video frame analysis for key moments (low priority)
- **Fallback**: Skip video analysis, rely on tweet text and thumbnail

**Technical Approach**:
- Extend existing `contextExtractor.ts` to include image URLs
- Add vision model selection to configuration
- Implement image fetching with proper error handling
- Include visual context in existing prompt construction
- Feature flag controlled with user preference

**Consumer-First Design**:
- **Invisible to User**: Works automatically, no new UI complexity
- **Optional**: Can be disabled in settings for cost-conscious users  
- **Fast**: Parallel processing, doesn't block text reply generation
- **Robust**: Graceful degradation when images can't be analyzed

---

### 3. **Tones & Styles Split** 🎨
**Status**: 70% Complete (Backend exists, needs UI) ⚠️  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Description**: Refactor Templates into intuitive Tones (voice) + Styles (approach) system

**Current Problem**:
- Templates mix personality (how you sound) with approach (what you do)
- "Witty Question" vs "Sarcastic Agreement" creates confusing combinations
- Users think in terms of "I want to sound [TONE] while [STYLE]"

Excellent! This is an incredibly well-structured and thoughtful foundation for a powerful tool. Your categorization into Attitude, Register, Rhetoric, and Format, plus the modulator sliders, is a fantastic design pattern. It's modular, scalable, and gives users immense control.

Here are my suggestions for additions, changes, and enhancements, followed by the requested prompts for each item, including the negative ones.

---

### **Part 1: Enhancements and Additions to Your Lists**

Here are a few additions to round out your existing categories.

#### A) **Attitude** (Additions)
Your list is great. I'd add a few more nuanced options:

*   🤔 **Inquisitive/Curious** — Genuinely seeks to understand, less about challenging and more about learning. Different from Skeptical.
*   🎭 **Dramatic/Performative** — Exaggerated for effect, uses hyperbole.
*   😌 **Calm/Zen** — Serene, unbothered, focuses on a higher-level perspective.
*   🙌 **Enthusiastic** — Eager, high-energy, uses exclamation points generously.

#### B) **Register** (Additions)
You've covered the main professional and casual styles. Let's add more internet-native variants:

*   📚 **Storyteller/Narrative** — Frames the reply as a short story or anecdote.
*   🤡 **Shitposter/Meme-Lord** — Absurdist, non-sequitur, relies on in-jokes and meme formats.
*   💖 **Fan/Stanspeak** — Uses hyperbole, specific community slang, and effusive praise (e.g., "they ATE," "the king/queen of X").

#### C) **Rhetoric** (Additions)
A few more strategic moves:

*   😈 **Devil's Advocate** — Argue a contrary position for the sake of argument, often starting with "For the sake of argument..."
*   🔭 **Zoom Out/Big Picture** — Re-contextualizes the topic within a larger trend or historical context.
*   💥 **Counter-example** — Provides a single, powerful example that contradicts the original claim.
*   🙏 **Gratitude/Shout-out** — Acknowledges and thanks the user for their post or a specific point.

#### D) **Format** (Additions)
*   🖼️ **GIF/Meme Reply** — A reply centered around a relevant GIF or meme with minimal text.
*   ❓ **Quote-Tweet with a Question** — Instead of a TL;DR, it poses a question to the audience about the original tweet.

---

### **Part 2: The "Negative" Tones (New Category)**

This is a crucial addition. For user safety and to avoid your extension being de-platformed, **it's critical to add a strong warning/disclaimer in the UI** whenever a user selects one of these. Something like: "Warning: This tone may violate Twitter's Terms of Service and could result in account suspension. Use with extreme caution."

### E) **Antagonistic Attitudes** (Voice/Personality)

*   😠 **Mean/Hostile** — Directly insulting, belittling, and aggressive.
*   😒 **Sarcastic** — Mocks the original tweet using irony, saying the opposite of what is meant.
*   🙄 **Dismissive** — Treats the original tweet as irrelevant, unintelligent, or not worth consideration.
*   🔥 **Inflammatory** — Designed to provoke anger and start arguments; baiting.
*   🧐 **Condescending** — Speaks down to the original poster as if they are less intelligent or informed.
*   🤬 **Swearing/Profane** — Uses curse words for emphasis or insult.
*   💣 **Controversial** — Intentionally takes a widely unpopular or divisive stance on the topic.
*   🚨 **Threatening** — **[EXTREME DANGER]** Implies harm or negative consequences. This is almost always a direct ToS violation. Your LLM should likely have guardrails to refuse this, but listing the category is important for completeness.

---

### **Part 3: Prompts for the LLM Orchestrator**

Here are the prompts for every item. The `[Original Tweet Text]` is a placeholder for the tweet the user is replying to. The `[User's Core Idea]` is a placeholder for an optional, brief instruction from the user about the point they want to make.

By implementing this full, structured list with corresponding prompts, your extension will be incredibly versatile and powerful. The key will be the user interface that allows people to mix and match these components easily.

**Implementation**:
- Modify existing unified selector to show Tone × Style matrix
- Update prompt construction to combine tone + style instructions
- Migrate existing templates to new tone/style combinations
- Maintain backward compatibility with favorites/arsenal
- A/B test with subset of users before full rollout

**Consumer Benefits**:
- **More Intuitive**: "Sound casual while asking a question" vs complex template names
- **Better Combinations**: 10 tones × 10 styles = 100 possibilities vs 15 fixed templates
- **Faster Selection**: Users think naturally in tone + style terms
- **Cleaner UI**: Two simple dropdowns instead of long template list

**Technical Approach**:
- Extend `templatesAndTones.ts` configuration
- Update unified selector UI with two-step selection
- Modify prompt builder to combine tone + style instructions
- Add migration logic for existing user preferences
- Feature flag for gradual rollout

**Migration Strategy**:
- Current "Hot Take + Sarcastic" → "Sarcastic Tone + Hot Take Style"
- Current "Challenge Politely + Professional" → "Professional Tone + Polite Challenge Style"
- Maintain existing favorites by auto-mapping to closest tone/style combo

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Current Version**: v0.0.11 - Unified AI Interface  
**Next Release**: v0.0.12 - Core Features & UX  

**Remember**: We're building the best AI reply assistant for individual Twitter/X users, not an enterprise social media management platform. Every feature should make a regular user's Twitter experience better, faster, and more enjoyable.
