# TweetCraft Consumer-Focused Development TODO

This document contains simple, practical tasks for implementing consumer-focused features. We prioritize speed, simplicity, and user value over complex infrastructure.

## üö® **Core Philosophy: BUILD FOR CONSUMERS, NOT ENTERPRISES**
- Implement the simplest solution first
- Add complexity only when needed by actual user feedback  
- One clear path to success for each feature
- Direct implementation over abstraction

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FEATURES** (v0.0.1 MVP)

### 1. AI Reply Generation System ‚úÖ
- OpenRouter API integration  
- 12 tone presets with visual selector
- Thread context extraction (up to 4 tweets)
- Session-based response caching
- Chrome Manifest V3 architecture
- Memory management and cleanup

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts ‚úÖ  
- Alt+Q: Generate AI reply using default tone
- Simple, single shortcut (no complex navigation)

---

## üîÆ **CONSUMER-FOCUSED ROADMAP**

### Phase 1: Content Creation (High Priority)

#### 1.1 Thread Composer
**Goal**: Help users create multi-tweet threads easily
**Implementation**: Simple popup interface
- Text area for thread content
- Auto-split into tweets (character limit)
- Preview with tweet numbers
- Generate button ‚Üí paste into Twitter

#### 1.2 Quote Tweet Generator  
**Goal**: Smart commentary for quote tweets
**Implementation**: Detect quote tweet context
- Extract original tweet content
- Generate relevant commentary
- Suggest different angles (agreement, counterpoint, question)

#### 1.3 AI Tweet Creation
**Goal**: Generate original tweets from topics
**Implementation**: Topic input ‚Üí style selection ‚Üí generation
- Topic input field
- Style options (informative, funny, question, opinion)
- Generate 3 variations, user picks

### Phase 2: Automated Posting (High Priority - Approved)

#### 2.1 Smart Posting System
**Goal**: Optional automated posting with user control
**Implementation**: POST by default, user can enable
- Toggle in settings (OFF by default)
- Multiple posting methods with fallbacks
- User confirmation before first auto-post
- Clear success/failure feedback

#### 2.2 Post Scheduling  
**Goal**: Basic scheduling for generated content
**Implementation**: Simple time picker
- Generate content ‚Üí schedule for later
- Browser notification when posted
- Cancel/edit scheduled posts

### Phase 3: Analytics & Growth (Medium Priority - Approved)

#### 3.1 Psychology Analytics
**Goal**: Help users understand engagement patterns  
**Implementation**: Simple insights dashboard
- Track which tones get most engagement
- Show engagement patterns over time
- Simple recommendations ("Try more questions")

#### 3.2 Growth Analytics
**Goal**: Basic follower and engagement tracking
**Implementation**: Lightweight metrics dashboard  
- Follower count trend
- Engagement rate tracking
- Best performing content types
- Weekly summary

#### 3.3 Content Analysis
**Goal**: Predict engagement before posting
**Implementation**: Pre-post analysis
- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
- Engagement prediction score (1-10)
- Viral potential indicators
- Improvement suggestions

### Phase 4: Enhanced Experience (Low Priority)

#### 4.1 Research Assistant
**Goal**: Add credible information to tweets
**Implementation**: Fact-checking integration
- Detect factual claims in tweets
- Suggest supporting links/sources
- Quick fact verification
- Citation formatting

#### 4.2 Better UI/UX
**Goal**: Smoother user experience  
**Implementation**: Incremental improvements
- Improved tone selector design
- Better error messages
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES**

### Start Simple
- Build minimal viable version first
- Test with real users before adding complexity
- One feature at a time, fully polished

### Consumer-First Testing
- Does it solve a real problem for individuals?
- Can new users figure it out in under 2 minutes?
- Is it faster than the manual alternative?
- Would you use this yourself daily?

### Technical Guidelines
- Use existing patterns from current codebase
- Extend `src/services/openRouter.ts` for new AI features
- Add settings to existing popup interface
- Keep bundle size under 2MB
- Maintain sub-2 second response times

---

## üìã **REMOVED OVERENGINEERED FEATURES**

The following enterprise-focused features have been explicitly removed from the roadmap:

### ‚ùå Removed Infrastructure
- Custom Memory Manager classes (use simple cleanup patterns)
- Complex keyboard shortcut systems (single Alt+Q sufficient)
- Multi-Provider API Orchestration (start with one reliable API)
- Message Bus Systems (direct function calls sufficient)
- Advanced Security Frameworks (Chrome's built-in security sufficient)

### ‚ùå Removed Complexity  
- Command Palette Systems (enterprise power-user pattern)
- Complex Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff (simple retry sufficient)
- Custom Error Handler Classes (basic try-catch sufficient)
- Advanced DOM Selector Systems (direct selectors until they break)

### ‚úÖ Consumer-Focused Alternatives
- Instead of complex systems: Simple, direct implementations
- Instead of multiple APIs: One reliable provider with basic fallback
- Instead of advanced patterns: Straightforward code that works
- Instead of power-user features: Intuitive interfaces for everyone

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

Each feature must pass these tests before implementation:
1. **Consumer Benefit**: Does this solve a real problem for individual users?
2. **Simplicity Test**: Can a new user understand it immediately?  
3. **Speed Test**: Is it faster than doing it manually?
4. **Daily Use Test**: Would you personally use this feature every day?

**If a feature fails any test, simplify or remove it.**

**Remember**: We're building the best AI reply assistant for individual Twitter/X users, not an enterprise social media management platform.
