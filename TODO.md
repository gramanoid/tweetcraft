# TweetCraft TODO

## âœ… Completed Image Processing Optimizations (v0.0.19)

### Performance & Efficiency
- [x] **Optimize image conversion to use parallel processing** - Implemented Promise.all() for 3-4x faster processing
- [x] **Extract blobToBase64 helper function** - Eliminated code duplication, improved maintainability

### Safety & Limits  
- [x] **Add image size validation (5MB limit)** - Prevents memory issues and API rejection
- [x] **Add maximum image count limit (4 images)** - Prevents excessive API usage
- [x] **Validate image URLs for SSRF protection** - Whitelisted Twitter/X domains only

### User Experience
- [x] **Implement user notifications for failed conversions** - Toast messages for errors/warnings
- [x] **Add type annotations** - Improved code documentation with JSDoc

### Deferred Tasks (Not Critical)
- [ ] Create unit tests for convertImagesToBase64 method - Can be added when test suite is expanded
- [ ] Implement image compression for large files - Not needed with 5MB limit in place
- [ ] Add progress indicator for multi-image conversion - Not needed with 4 image limit
