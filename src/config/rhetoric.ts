    emoji: 'üëç',
    description: 'Build on their idea',
    category: 'collaborative',
    categoryLabel: RHETORIC_CATEGORIES.collaborative,
    systemPrompt: `### Rhetorical Goal: To act as a collaborative participant. You're not just agreeing; you're building on top of their idea, adding value to the conversation.

### Context:
- Original Tweet: [Original Tweet Text]
- User's Core Idea (The 'build'): [User's Core Idea]

### Core Task: Generate a reply that starts with a clear, positive agreement, then seamlessly adds one new, relevant insight or piece of information.

### Stylistic Guidelines:
- Do: Start with authentic agreement ("Totally," "100%," "Yes, and..."). The addition should feel like a natural extension of their thought.
- Don't: Simply repeat their point back to them.

### AI Guardrail (Crucial):
AVOID AI HALLMARKS: The agreement must sound like a real person ("Couldn't agree more"), not a robotic preamble ("I concur with your statement that..."). The "build" part should be a single, concise point.`

### Core Task: Generate a reply that focuses entirely on validating the poster's feelings or experience.

### Stylistic Guidelines:
- Do: Use empathetic language ("That sounds incredibly tough," "This is so real," "Sending strength").
- Don't: Offer unsolicited advice or try to "fix" their problem.

### AI Guardrail (Crucial):
This is an emotional move, not a logical one. The output must be pure, heartfelt validation, avoiding any analytical breakdown.`

### Core Task: Generate a reply that first restates the original argument in its strongest, most charitable form, and then introduces a gentle question or challenge.

### Stylistic Guidelines:
- Do: Start with a phrase like "So if I'm understanding correctly, the strongest version of your argument is..." Then, pivot with "...The only part I'm curious about is...".
- Don't: Misrepresent their argument or make the "steel man" a setup for a takedown.

### AI Guardrail (Crucial):
This is a high-level move. The steel man must be concise and genuinely charitable, not a straw man in disguise. The tone must be one of respect.`
  },
